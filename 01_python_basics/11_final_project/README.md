# Final Project: ML Pipeline

This module brings together concepts from previous chapters (Lists, Dictionaries, Exceptions, Files, Classes) into a unified script.

## Contents

- **`ml_pipeline.py`**: A complete example script that processes a list of model results.

## Key Features

1.  **Data Structure**: Uses a list of dictionaries to represent model results.
2.  **Class Structure**: `ModelEvaluator` class encapsulates the logic.
3.  **Error Handling**: `try-except` block handles malformed data (string "FEHLER" instead of a number).
4.  **File I/O**: `save_report` method writes the filtered results to a file.
