# Loops: For and While

This module focuses on iteration using loops in Python.

## Contents

- **`password_prompt.py`**: demonstrates a `while` loop that continues to prompt the user until the correct password is entered.

## Key Concepts

- **While Loops**: Executing a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.
- **For Loops**: Iterating over a sequence (though not explicitly shown in the example file, it is a core concept of this section theme).
- **Input Handling**: Using `input()` to receive user data.
