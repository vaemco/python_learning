# File Handling

This module shows how to interact with the file system, specifically writing data to files.

## Contents

- **`training_logger.py`**: demonstrates opening a file (using the `with` statement) and writing lines of text to it.

## Key Concepts

- **Opening Files**: `open()` function.
- **Modes**: `'w'` for writing (overwrite), `'a'` for appending, `'r'` for reading.
- **Context Managers**: Using `with` to ensure files are closed automatically.
